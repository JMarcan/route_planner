# route_planner

## Motivation
I did this project as part of Udacity, Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree that I took to ensure that my code is written efficiently. 
This is especially important for solutions that needs to be scaled. Or solutions with limited computing power. As robots.

## Project description
![Network graph](assets/network_graph.png)

The goal of the project was to build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. For sure, the one used in Google Maps is much more optimized.
To achive this, I have implemented A* search with euclidean distance heuristics.

The original heuristic calculation was:
```
distance = math.sqrt(((x1-x2)**2) + (y1-y2)**2) 
```

However, the following heuristics calculation works well too and is much faster as it has no square root calculations. (thank the @Reviewer for the tip!)
```
abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
```
